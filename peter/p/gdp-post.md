When I hear people say “GDP” I kinda know what they’re talking about, but I realize that it is only a shallow understanding.  A thorough and simple explanation has never been given to me. 
### GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the theoretical amount of money that all of the goods and services produced by someone somewhere in a period of time is worth.

Read that a couple of times to really soak it in. Many people are familiar with that definition, but few are sure what all the words in the definition really mean – and that is pretty important.

**“Services”** is the stuff people do, that has a value. For example a massage.
**“Someone”** is often the inhabitants of a country or region, but you can calculate GDP of any specified group of people. 

**GNP** is almost as commonly heard in debates as GDP. It is almost the same but it’s on the “somewhere” that it differs. Whereas GDP only takes in to account products produced inside the country, GNP counts all products produced which are owned by the inhabitants of the country. So globally GDP and GNP are equal, but in many western countries the GNP is a lot higher because many companies have their big factories in Asia.
 **“Worth”** is probably the iffiest part of the explanation. By worth you mean the market value of the products and services. But what is market value?

Market value is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length (on equal terms) transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties each act knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion. In other words, the amount a property sells for in a fair transaction where both parties know what they’re doing.

But don’t we have a problem here? We all know how the kebab you buy in the central part of town is much more expensive than the one you buy in the less wealthy suburbs, and in both places transactions seem pretty fair and knowledgeable. So what would the market value of the kebab be?  

![kebab](/assets/images/gdp-post/kebab.png "kebab")

These deviations in price are due to market inefficiency. Market inefficiency is a natural consequence of things like price of transport, local taxes and import duties, different perceived values, local differences in supply and demand and ultimately the diversity of humans and society. Market inefficiency causes different market prices (the price at which you can transact) in different places, but the market value remains the true underlying value of the product. The market price would equal the market value in a 100% efficient market. So to round off with the kebab. In the real world the market value of the kebab isn’t apparent only the market prices, so you would have to estimate the market value of the kebab. You would do that by guessing at what the price would be in a market adjusted for market inefficiency. The estimate would probably land somewhere in between the expensive kebab in the central part town and the price in the poor suburbs.

There is another twist to the “worth”. Take a wooden hat as an example.  First a forestry company cuts down some trees and sells the logs to a sawmill company. Then the sawmill company makes the logs into planks and sell them to a hatter who turns the lumber into hats. Do you count the value of the logs, the planks and the hat into the GDP? The answer is no, because then you would be counting the same value thrice. Instead you count the final value of goods that aren’t manufactured further, and leave out the values further down the production chain. 

Now you know what all the words in the definition of GDP mean – now you REALLY know what GDP means.

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the amount of money that all of the things and services produced by someone somewhere in a period of time is worth.**

If you’re only interested in understanding the basics of what GDP means you don’t need to read any further. But there are more aspects necessary for a more complete understanding of the concept and what it can be used for. Let’s take a look at that now.

One of the most common uses of GDP is for comparing economies.

Before we start comparing economies we realize that almost every country has its own currency. This means that we need to convert the currencies we are dealing with into the same currency in order for the comparison to make any sort of sense. For converting currencies, we use exchange rates.  If nothing else is specified it means that market exchange rates are being used. Market exchange rates are the ones you exchange by when you go on vacation in another country or go to the bank. 

GDP of Norway in 2014: 499.82 billion USD

GDP of India 2014: 2066,90 billion USD

Bruh… 

(cool drawing… huh?)

GDP is a measure of the size of an economy – how much it produces. By tweaking GDP and the way, you compare different countries’ GDP you can make comparisons that tell you more than just who has the biggest economy.

In the world we live in, money is a prime factor to your standard of living. Other factors like location and culture are also important, but money is definitely a game changer. This means that we can not only use GDP for comparing sizes of economies we can also use it for comparing standard of living in different places.
Ok, so India’s GDP was larger than Norway’s GDP, so it’s obvious that we need to make a few tweaks if we want an idea of the wealth and standard of living of the average citizen. If we wanted to compare the standard of living in the two countries, then first of all we should divide by the countries’ populations. Then we get **GDP per capita**.

 ![formula](/assets/images/gdp-post/formula.png "formula")

GDP per capita of Norway (2014): 67245.60 USD 

GDP per capita of India (2014): 1262.64 USD

Now the picture is radically changed. It turns out that when you the take the size of the populations into account, the Norwegian, by average, produces much more value than the Indian and thus it’s likely that he is much wealthier. 

We can go on and further improve how well our comparisons work for comparing the standard of living by using exchange rates that result in equal purchasing power in the countries. **This is GDP (at Purchasing Power Parity) per capita or GDP PPP per capita**.

Purchasing power is how far a unit of currency gets you. For example, if you imagine going into a store with one unit of currency in the 1950’s it is likely that you would be able to purchase more items, than you would today. This indicates that the purchasing power of that unit of currency was greater in the 1950’s. Purchasing power also varies from country to country. A dollar gets you much further in India than it does back in the US, if you exchanged using market exchange rates, which leads me on to the next part of the explanation.

A purchasing power paired exchange rate is an exchange rate so that the dollar gets you just as far in India as it did in the US.  Or to generalize that: a purchasing power paired exchange rate results in amounts for which you could purchase the same basket of goods in the country you exchanged to as in the one you exchanged from.
The relative version of the PPP exchange rate is calculated using this simple formula:

![formula1](/assets/images/gdp-post/formula1.png "formula1")

S represents the purchasing power paired exchange rate

p<sub>1</sub> represents price of good “x” in currency 1 in country 1

p<sub>2</sub> represents price of good “x” in currency 2 in country 2

Example: let’s quickly try out the formula. 

Price of big mac in US = $3.57

Price of big mac in UK = £2,29 

![formula2](/assets/images/gdp-post/formula2.png "formula2")

Let’s exchange £20 to dollars using the PPP exchange rate:

![formula3](/assets/images/gdp-post/formula3.png "formula3")

Exchanging the other way, we divide by the PPP exchange rate.

![formula4](/assets/images/gdp-post/formula4.png "formula4")

**GDP PPP per capita** is GDP per capita exchanged to the comparing currency (dollars) using **purchasing power paired exchange rates**. 
This is a map of the world colored according to the size of the countries’ GDP per capita. Darker means higher GDP PPP per capita.

![map](/assets/images/gdp-post/map.png "map")

As you can see, the map fits pretty well with our perception of where the standard of living is high and low – with some exceptions, for example Saudi Arabia. This is due to massive inequality – that can be adjusted for too using something called the Gini coefficient, but that’s for another day.

Last thing I want to cover in this post is **economic growth**. Referred to as “growth” the term appears in the public debate frequently. Economic growth is the increase in GDP (often per capita) over time.  Growth gives an idea of how the economy is developing at the time.

When comparing GDP over time it is useful to adjust for inflation (footnote: inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy over time). GDP adjusted for inflation is called **real GDP** - opposed to nominal GDP, which is the actual amount not adjusted in any way. Real GDP is superior when comparing over time because it eliminates the distorting effects of inflation.
This graph shows UK real GDP per capita over time:

And now this graph shows the **growth in real UK GDP** over time:

![graph2](/assets/images/gdp-post/graph2.png "graph2")

This graph is useful for getting an idea of how the UK economy was developing at different times. Around 2008 it was going bad.

#### These were the points you learned about in this post.
