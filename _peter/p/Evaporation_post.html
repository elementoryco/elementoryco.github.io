	<b style="text-align:left;font-weight: bold;font-size:22px; font-family: antic_slab"> We’ve all tried pouring up a glass of water, and not drinking all of it, but then the next day the glass is empty anyway. When you think about it, that is actually a pretty cool magic trick – the water disappears into thin air! Or maybe that’s just me… </b>
	<p style="font-family: antic_slab;font-size:18px">In fact, it’s vital that liquid water can “disappear into thin air” because 97% of all water on earth is stored in the oceans and the rest would quickly trickle back into the oceans if it weren’t for this property and then all the land surface would turn into one big desert and we would all die.</p>

	<p style="font-family: antic_slab;font-size:18px">So yeah, this ability of “disappearing into thin air” is not unique to water (all liquids can do it) and it’s called evaporation. Evaporation is one of two ways vaporization can happen. Vaporization is the phase transition from liquid to gas.</p>
	<p style="font-family: antic_slab;font-size:18px">To fully understand evaporation, we need to first take a look at the atom. As you probably know, pretty much all matter in the universe is built of atoms. Atoms are built of negatively charged electrons clouding around a nucleus of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. </p>
